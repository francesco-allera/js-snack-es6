# Ex. 31 - Boolean Careers Trainee:

## Languages used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JAVASCRIPT ES5
- JAVASCRIPT ES6

### Purpose of the exercise:

Practicing more advanced notions of JavaScript (let/const, block scope, template literal, dynamic keys, destructuring).

Collection of small exercises done first in ES5, then in ES6:

1. Create an array of objects. Each object will describe a bike with 'name' and 'weight' properties. Print the bike with the lowest weight.
2. Create an array of soccer team objects. Each team will have the properties: name, points scored, fouls incurred. Name will be the only property to be filled in, the others will all be set to 0. Then, generate random numbers instead of 0s in the properties. Create a new array whose elements contain only names and fouls incurred and print everything.
3. Write a function that accepts 3 arguments, an array and 2 numbers (A smaller than B). The function will return a new array with the values that have the position between the 2 numbers.
